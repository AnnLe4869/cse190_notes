# Notes

From lecture 2

A typical board for most electronic devices often have:

- A microcontroller (red square)
- Power control unit (blue square)
- Flash storage to store permanent data (yellow square)
- Bluetooth or Wifi module interface (green square)

Microcontroller vs Digital signal processing (DSP)

DSP is a microcontroller that is specialized built to handle signal. For example, DSP may have built-in function to calculate sine wave or Fourier transform, can do multiple matrix calculation at the same time; while normal controller cannot do the same thing

For normal computer processor, there are only two major ISA: Intel x86 and Arm. For embedded computing there are no dominance ISA - it pretty much depends on the team and the hardware they use - like what family of controller they use (Texas Instrument, Intel, ARM, etc.)
